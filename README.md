# Murzik's proximity chat (discord version)
probably working proximity chat

sometimes doesn't work because of discord

**THIS PLUGIN WON'T WORK AFTER MAY 4** ( because discord are deprecating lobbies )

after you get the plugin and mod you are done yay

# UI
apprently my ux is bad so I need to explain it -_-       this is why I don't like frontend

this window is nice. right?

so if you want to be in a private lobby, just overwrite the lobby name

like this
